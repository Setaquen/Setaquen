                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    This page is about me. I am mostly interested in programming, web development, and game design/developement.<br>
                    Apart from programming, I enjoy(at least enjoyed) reading books. I love playing games, especially Minecraft!<br>
                    I am currently studying Computer Education and Instructional Technology at the Middle East Technical University.<br>
                    I am currently 19 years old. I know English and Turkish, and trying to learn little bit of French.<br>
                    If you have any questions or want to know more about me, Feel free to reach out to me via the Contact Me page!
